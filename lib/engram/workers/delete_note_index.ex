  Oban worker: deletes Qdrant points and DB chunks for a soft-deleted note.

  Enqueued from `Notes.delete_note/3`. Args carry `path_hmac` (base64), not
  plaintext `path` — see encryption tier-3 audit T3.2 / H3. Plaintext in
  `oban_jobs.args` JSONB defeats Phase B at-rest encryption for the
  duration of any in-flight or recently-completed job.

  # with a structured reason so a stale enqueue from a rolled-back deploy
  # does not raise FunctionClauseError + retry storm. Crucially, the
  # legacy `path` plaintext key is exactly the leak T3.2/H3 closed —
