"""Shared conflict test setup — used by test_06, test_13, test_14, test_21, test_22,
test_54.

Extracts two patterns:

1. ``setup_conflict`` — the original 5-step pattern used by test_06/13/14/21/22:
   A creates base note, B syncs to get it, A edits, B pauses and edits locally.
   Requires api_sync fixture.

2. ``setup_conflict_for_a`` / ``restore_after_conflict`` — the simpler 2-party
   pattern for test_54 (ConflictModal UI):
   B writes remote content and syncs to server, then A writes local content and
   triggers pull so that Vault A detects divergence and opens ConflictModal
   (requires ``conflictResolution == 'modal'`` already set on A before call).
   Does NOT require api_sync.

    The plugin only treats a divergent pull as a *real* conflict when both:

      - it has a recorded ``syncedHash`` for the file (so the local edit is
        provably user-modified, not first-sync staleness), AND
      - ``localContent != remoteContent``.

    Without a recorded sync state the engine falls into its first-sync staleness
    heuristic (``STALE_THRESHOLD_S = 3600`` s; see src/sync.ts ~1330) and may
    silently accept the remote, never opening ConflictModal.

    So we establish a synced *base* first:

    1. A writes ``base`` content and triggers a full sync — server now has the
       base AND ``syncState`` on A records its hash.
    2. B also fully syncs so B has the same base recorded locally.
    3. Pause A's outgoing sync so A's divergent edit stays off-server.
    4. A writes ``local`` (diverges from base).
    5. B writes ``remote`` (diverges from base) and full-syncs — server now
       carries B's divergent version.
    6. Resume A's outgoing sync, then trigger a pull — A sees server content
       that differs from its local content AND its recorded base hash; with
       ``conflictResolution == 'modal'`` set, ConflictModal opens.

    If ``base`` is None, a deterministic placeholder is derived from ``path``.

    The caller MUST set ``conflictResolution = 'modal'`` on A before calling
    (the ``_set_modal_mode`` autouse fixture in test_54 does this).

    Waits up to 10 s for the modal DOM node to appear; raises TimeoutError if
    it never mounts.
