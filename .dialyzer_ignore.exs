  # AAD helpers — `aad_for_row/3`, `aad_for_qdrant/3`, `aad_for_wrapped_dek/1` are
  # intentionally specced as `binary()` so callers don't depend on the exact byte
  # layout. Dialyzer's success typing (with the `:underspecs` flag) infers tighter
  # `<<_::N, _::_*8>>` shapes from the literal-string concatenation, but narrowing
  # the spec would leak implementation details to call sites and make any
  # caller-side `binary()` parameter type fail to match.

  # Dialyzer's success typing for `Path.rootname/1` (and possibly Regex helpers
  # called inside extract_title/2) reports a phantom `{integer(), integer()}`
  # return type that no real call path produces — every internal helper is
  # guarded with `is_binary/1`. Widening the spec to include the phantom would
  # mislead callers; ignoring the missing_range warning here is safe.

  # `identify_from_blob/1` is intentionally specced as `term()` because callers
  # pass values straight from DB columns (which may be nil) or from arbitrary
  # external input — the function gracefully handles every shape via the
  # `_other` catch-all clause. Dialyzer's success typing infers a narrower
  # binary-shape union from the leading three pattern matches, but the spec
  # has to remain `term()` so future callers don't fail type-check at the
  # boundary. Same pattern as the AAD helpers above.
